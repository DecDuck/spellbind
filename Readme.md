# Spellbind
Spellbind is a magical overhaul mod for the Sapiens video game. Now your Sapiens can become wizards and witches, and use magic to their advantage!

## Using
Spellbind is in ***very*** early stages of development. There is next to no content, and is most likely *extremely* buggy. Anways...
### Installing
For unversioned releases, Spellbind often depends on modules not part of the core Hammerstone, so make sure to grab Hammerstone from my personal fork [here](https://github.com/DecDuck/hammerstone-framework)

For versioned releases, definitely get the proper Hammerstone, as it's much more stable and bug free.

### Contributing
Make a fork, make some changes, create Pull Request, as normal.

I like moderately commented code, so make sure someone else knows what each option does.
